<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My nickname's Yan. I am an aspiring web developer whose current profession is related to the construction industry.
  I am curently enrolled in Dr. Angela Yu's WebDev Bootcamp and this website is one of the projects being accomplished to practice what I learned so far from the bootcamp.
</p>
<p>I took an interest in website development back when I was 14 years old when we were taught about HTML codes in high school and  I was able to create a simple website by just those codes. 
  However, when I went to college, I traversed a different course due to practical reasons. It's a long story!
</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, that's 2 decades, I'm back here again and a LOT has changed. It's even more challenging and complex but I'm still as excited at the prospect of creating beautiful and professional websites.
